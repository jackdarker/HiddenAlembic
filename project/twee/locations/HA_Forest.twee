As you wander off the path through the forest you hear something move in the underbrush. 
You guess it might be ... (detection improves on failure)
Hide in a bush
Climb Tree
Run
Grab a branch
Stand your ground

Stag/deer -> charm if you stand still or hide in bush
Cougar  -> catch you if on tree or run; safe if stand still or offensive
Wolfes -> catch you if you run or hide in bush; safe on tree
Bear -> catch if hiding or offensive; safe on tree or run
Fox (might be a Kitsune) -> charm if you stand still
Hunter -> catch you if standstill or offensive; safe if hiding
Logger -> catch you if on tree
Werwulf ->
Fairy/Dryad -> 
Giant Bat -> 
Giant Snake ->
if you pass, you gain some fur of the animal
if you fail, shred your clothes, rape you

    You push through the undergrow of this filthy forest as you notice that further up the it seems to get brighter.
    As you walk on and climb a steep dirtpath, you finally make it above the tree line.
    You spot some deteriorated walls and a stonetower. 
    <p class="tPC">"This has to be the lookout point. Lets check the tower."</p>
    Unfortunalty the entrance to the tower is barraged with some wodden door. There is no lock but the rotten old thing seems to not move an inch.
    <p class="tPC">"I guess it wouldnt be save to climb that tower if its stairs are as rotten as its door."</p>
    Making your way around the tower you find that you dont need that tower anyway. There is a cliffside and you have a unhinderned view into the valley.
    <p class="tPC">"That has to be Redwick and there is the road."</p>
    You cant see Barellless from here as it is hidden behind the forest trees. 
    Du benutzt deine HÃ¤nde um deine Augen von der Sonne abzuschirmen.
    <p class="tPC">"Hmm, is that a carriage halted on the side of the road?"</p>
    Indeed there seems some handwaggon some miles up the road midst in the woods. But you cant spot anyone close by.
    <p class="tPC">"I better report back to the innkeeper."</p>    
<%}else{%>
    You find your way back to the lookout point
